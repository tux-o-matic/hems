## WIP

Use the following command to find out what video format is generated by your video source:
```shell
v4l2-ctl --all
```
This utility requires the *v4l-utils* package.

```shell
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! "video/x-raw,format=YUY2,width=640,height=480,type=video,framerate=(fraction)30/1" ! videoscale ! videoconvert ! x264enc tune=zerolatency bitrate=500 speed-preset=superfast ! "video/x-h264,profile=main" ! rtph264pay ! udpsink host=127.0.0.1 port=5000
```

Then to consume it, write in a text file ending in *.sdp*:

```shell
c=IN IP4 127.0.0.1
m=video 5000 RTP/AVP 96
a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000
```
This sdp file can be then used by VideoCapture() in OpenCV or any video client such as VLC.

OpenCV using ffmpeg will complain about missing key frame if the video stream is started before the OpenCV program.
